This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by incorrectly using the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from updating the `count` state variable within the `useEffect`'s dependency array, leading to continuous re-renders and a never-ending loop. The solution shows how to avoid this by using the functional update pattern or by removing the dependency entirely if the effect does not need to depend on count.
